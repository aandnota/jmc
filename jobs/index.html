                Creighton University invites applications for a tenure track faculty position in Computer Science. The appointment begins in August 2018 and is tenure-track at the Assistant Professor level. We seek an individual with the potential to be an excellent teacher-scholar and an exemplary mentor for undergraduate students. Creighton University, in the heart of Omaha, Nebraska, is the top-ranked Midwest University by U.S. News &amp; World Report for 15 straight years, and has been widely recognized for its outstanding liberal arts programs and its commitment to undergraduate research and internships. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The Computer Science program at Creighton is a traditional liberal-arts program, offering a B.S. degree that aligns with the ACM/IEEE 2013 Model Curriculum. It is housed in the innovative, cross-disciplinary Department of Journalism, Media & Computing, which also includes Journalism and Graphic Design. Students in all three majors complete foundational courses in computing, writing, and design, before focusing on their specific major content. Class sizes are small (typically 10-30 students) and faculty-student interaction is central to our mission. Standard teaching load is three courses per semester, with reductions possible for new faculty and faculty with research grants. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Candidates for this position must have earned (or be no more than one year from completing) a Ph.D. in computer science or a closely related field, and should possess a strong desire to teach in a liberal arts environment. Applicants must apply at <a href="http://careers.creighton.edu"> http://careers.creighton.edu</a> and submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae, and mission statement. In addition, please send three letters of recommendation, undergraduate and graduate transcripts, and documentation (if available) of teaching effectiveness to: Department of Journalism, Media &amp; Computing, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178-0103, attn: Dr. David Reed (or electronically to <a href="mailto:davereed@creighton.edu"> davereed@creighton.edu</a>). Application review will begin December 15, and continue until the position is filled.
