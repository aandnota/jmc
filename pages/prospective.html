					<h2>Prospective Students</h2>
					<p id="prosp-text">The media industry might not look the way it did five years ago, but the new look is opening scores of opportunities for writers, designers, developers, strategists, public relations and advertising professionals. Many of those opportunities will be for jobs that didn’t exist 10 years ago.</p>

					<p id="prosp-text-sec">JM&amp;C’s innovative approach that combines traditional journalism practice with design and computer science offers journalism, graphic design and computer science majors benefits in the fast-evolving world of communication and computing. The foundations of all three – journalism, graphic design and computer science – form a strong basis for each major. The writing, design and programming skills each student develops help to make a JM&C major even more competitive in the job market.</p>

					<p id="prosp-text-sec">JM&C majors typically have at least one internship to help them hone their skills and build their portfolios. Opportunities like the weekly Creightonian newspaper and Creightonian Online, the Public Relations Student Society of America, AIGA, the professional society for design, and the Computer Science Club offer students more experience and the chance to network with professionals. The Backpack Journalism project gives students a chance to experience life on the margins in a developing country or in the United States while filming and editing a documentary film.</p>
