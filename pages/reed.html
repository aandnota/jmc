						<p>Over the years, I have taught a wide variety of courses, ranging from a non-majors course, to core computer science courses, to advanced topics. My general philosophy is to conduct hands-on, interactive classes that challenge the student to learn by experience. I don't mind having a reputation for being tough, as long as students feel that I am fair and that they learn.
						</p>
						<p>My current interests in teaching and curriculum development center on the Web as a medium for programming and experimentation. I developed my first Web-based programming class all the way back in 1997 – an introduction to computer science that used JavaScript and interactive Web pages to teach programming fundamentals.  Over the years, I adapted this course to serve as an introduction to computing for non-majors. The hands-on nature of the course is achieved using tutorials, in which the students write and experiment with small, Web-based programs.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Experimental and analytical skills are stressed as students often use programs as means to model and analyze complex systems (such as random walks and ecosystem models). In addition, students are introduced to the history and breadth of computer science, with readings and exercises on topics such as logic design, artificial intelligence, and the societal impact. A text book based on this course, titled A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science, was published by Prentice Hall in 2004 with a second edition released in 2007 and a third edition in 2010.</p>

						<p>David Reed is an Associate Professor and Director of Computer Science &amp; Informatics at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska. He received his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from Duke University in 1992, and subsequently taught and conducted research at Duke University and Dickinson College before joining the faculty at Creighton in 2000. His primary interests are in programming languages and computer science education, where he has published extensively on topics such as apprentice-based learning, Web-based programming, and innovative instructional methods in introductory computer science. His recent scholarship and service has focused on bridging K-12 and college computer science education.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Dr. Reed is author of a CS0 text, A Balanced Introduction to Computer Science, which is currently in its third edition and has been widely adopted at both colleges and high schools. He has been an active contributor in the AP Computer Science program for more than two decades, serving as Chief Reader from 2004 through 2008.  He also served on the ACM/IEEE Computer Science 2013 Steering Committee, which produced the influential Computer Science Curricula 2013 report. He is a member of the Liberal Arts Computer Science Consortium and the Board of Directors of the Computer Science Teachers Association, where he has served as Chair since 2015.</p>
