                Creighton University invites applications for a Clare Boothe Luce Faculty Chair in Computer Science. The appointment begins in August 2017 and is tenure-track at the Assistant Professor level. The position is a rotating chair, established under the terms of the <a href="http://www.hluce.org">Luce Foundation</a> to increase the representation of women in STEM careers.  After an appointment of up to five years, the recipient is eligible for tenure and advancement as a regular member of the Department of Journalism, Media &amp; Computing. We seek an individual with the potential to be an excellent teacher-scholar and an exemplary mentor for undergraduate women interested in STEM careers. 
              </p>

              <p>
                The <a href="http://biology.creighton.edu/luce/Clare_Boothe_Luce_Professors.html">Clare Boothe Luce Faculty Chair</a> at Creighton University was established by the Luce Foundation in 1992. The chair, which rotates among the sciences every five years, entails salary and research support, a reduced teaching load, and a substantial budget for student mentoring and outreach activities.  The holder of the chair is responsible for overseeing the Clare Boothe Luce Undergraduate Scholarship program and for organizing career and research mentoring activities for women interested in careers from STEM-related fields, including computer science. As with any other tenure-track position, tenure and advancement require effective teaching and development of a research program leading to peer-reviewed publications. Opportunities exist for research collaboration with faculty both within the department and in other university departments.
              </p>

              <p>
                The Computer Science program at Creighton is a traditional liberal-arts program, offering a B.S. degree that aligns with the ACM/IEEE 2013 Model Curriculum. It is is housed in the innovative, cross-disciplinary Department of Journalism, Media & Computing, which also includes Journalism and Graphic Design. Students in all three majors complete foundational courses in computing, writing, and design, before focusing on their specific major content. Class sizes are small (typically 10-30 students) and faculty-student interaction is central to our mission. Most faculty teach three courses per semester, although the Clare Boothe Luce Faculty Chair receives one course reduction per year and there may be further opportunities to reduce teaching load with research funding.
              </p>

              <p>
                Candidates for this position must have earned (or be no more than one year from completing) a Ph.D. in computer science or a closely related field, and should possess a strong desire to teach in a liberal arts environment. Applicants must apply at <a href="http://careers.creighton.edu">http://careers.creighton.edu</a> and submit a cover letter, curriculum vitae, and mission statement. In addition, please send three letters of recommendation, undergraduate and graduate transcripts, and documentation (if available) of teaching effectiveness to: Department of Journalism, Media & Computing, Creighton University, Omaha, NE 68178-0103, attn: Dr. David Reed. Application review will begin October 21, 2017, and continue until the position is filled.
